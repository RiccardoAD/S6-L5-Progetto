    <div class="row justify-content-center">
        <div class="col-10 mx-0 mb-5">

            <div class=" bg-welcome">
                <div class="card-body">

                    <h5 class="card-title">How does it work?</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">Animus technology functions in much the way a simulator/projector does. Your
                        consciousness will tap into the genetic coding in such a way that everything will appear to all
                        your
                        senses as three-dimensional – putting you in the heart of the action. It’s adaptive, so as the
                        memories unfold, the “program” you experience begins to change subtly. They will appear to you
                        as
                        glitches and let you explore a memory much more closely.

                        While this is necessary for maximum benefit and, of course, your safety, we want the experience
                        to
                        be as smooth as possible. To that end, the Animus creates areas outside of the simulation:
                        Memory
                        Corridors and the White Room. The Memory Corridor functions like a loading screen, enabling a
                        safe
                        and efficient transition from one set of memories to another. At certain junctures, you’ll
                        experience a White Room effect, which enables you to focus carefully on information that will be
                        conveyed.

                        We furhter look out for our Research Analysts’ well-being through something we call
                        “synchronization.” This means monitoring and controlling what you experience and remember in
                        order
                        to reduce potential distress. The Animus Omega can automatically reconstruct memories tailored
                        to
                        what each tester can or cannot adjust to, to further decrease the already slim risk. It grows
                        and
                        adapts with you. Think about training in the gym – the more you work out, the fitter you become,
                        and
                        the more weight you can lift. So, the more time you spend in the Animus, the better you can
                        synchronize with what it can offer you. It’s the same idea.

                    </p>

                    <h5 class="card-title">So Abstergo Industries takes care of the safety issues, and the Animus takes
                        me
                        on the journey, what do I need to do?</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">We like to say, “Sit back and enjoy the ride.” But, of course, there’s a little
                        more to it than that. We will need you to bring yourself into the pictures sometimes, instead of
                        simply reliving your ancestor’s memories.

                        What that means is, from time to time, you’ll make judicious use of the White Room. You’ll take
                        the
                        time to master a skill so you can progress through the memories more swiftly and with more
                        efficiency. We’ll be monitoring and recording what you see and experience as well, of course, so
                        don’t ever worry that you’ll be alone!

                        Finally, once you are back to “yourself,” we’ll ask you to write down your thoughts,
                        observations,
                        feelings, and so on at certain phases. Your supervisor will critique your report and perhaps ask
                        some follow-up questions.

                        We do this because as a Research Analyst, you’re in the thick of the action, not us, and you are
                        the
                        best person to report on what you’re experiencing! This also helps us make extra sure that your
                        well-being isn’t being harmed in any way.

                        We understand this is a lot to take in. Remember, you supervisor is your best friend, so if you
                        ever
                        have any questions or concerns, please feel free to bring them up to him or her.

                        We hope you are as excited as we are about having your first experience in the Animus!

                                    We know that certain biological physical traits are passed down through genes. That’s
                                    why you’ve got your “father’s nose” and your brother has your “grandmother’s eyes.” The
                                    theory – theoretical no longer! – of genetic memory takes this one step further and
                                    posits that DNA contains so much more information just waiting to be mined. We’ve
                                    discovered the double helix is a cornucopia of experiences, memories, and skill sets
                                    just waiting to be unlocked.

                                    The late Warren Vidic, one of the world’s leading authorities on genetic memory, brought
                                    thirty years of research to creating the first Animus prototype. He was supervisor of
                                    the project from its inception until his untimely death in December 2012. Thanks to Dr.
                                    Vidic’s groundbreaking work, new avenues of knowledge and experiences are now open to
                                    our test subjects, and, through Abstergo Entertainment and the new Helix Project, soon
                                    to perhaps millions of others as well.
